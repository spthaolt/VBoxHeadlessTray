To use
------

1. Download and Install 

2. From Start menu -> Programs run VBoxHeadlessTray

3. Select a machine from the displayed list.  VBoxHeadlessTray will powerup the machine.

4. Right click the tray icon to start/stop/save etc...

If a VBoxHeadlessTray machine is running when Windows is shutdown, it will automatically 
save the machine's state and on Windows restarting, VBoxHeadlessTray will restart itself 
automatically and resume the VM.  

To prevent a machine starting at windows logon, exit VBoxHeadlessTray before shutting 
down windows, or use the -np option.

### Version 1.1

* Initial version, basic functionality and custom context menus

### Version 1.2

* Added ACPI commands for power button and sleep button (requires guest additions to be installed in the guest OS)
* Added a new command to launch Remote Desktop for the hosted machine
* Added two new commands "Open VirtualBox GUI" and "Go Headless" that switch between the headless hosting of the machine and the main VirtualBox GUI.  Note the machine needs to be saved and restored to perform this switch.
* Reorganised the context menu a bit.

### Version 3.2.0.1

* Updated to work with VirtualBox 3.2
* Changed version number to be in-sync with VirtualBox

### Version 3.2.0.2

* Fix to correctly locate VirtualBox when not installed in default location (uses HKLM\Software\Oracle\InstallDir)
* Fix to not turn on VRDP when launching headless process. (uses VBoxHeadless.exe --vrdp config)

### Version 4.0.0.0

* Updated to work with VirtualBox 4.0
* Fixes Resume command not working


### Version 4.0.0.1

* Fixed icon tray state reflecting state of incorrect VM.


### Version 4.1.0.1

* Updated to work with VirtualBox 4.1
* Due to apparent bugs in VirtualBox itself (not send machine state change notifications), the tray icon may be a little slow to update when starting and stopping the VM through the VirtualBox GUI.

### Version 4.2.0.1

* Updated to work with VirtualBox 4.2

### Version 4.2.0.3

* Fix for a crash on shutdown with some VM's




CommandLine Arguments
---------------------

Usage: VBoxHeadlessTray [-?|-h] [-np] <machinename>

Requirements
------------

VBoxHeadlessTray 3.2 requires VirtualBox 3.2 to be installed.
VBoxHeadlessTray 1.2 requires VirtualBox 3.1.2 to be installed.  

Machine execution, machine management and all other functionality is still supplied by Virtual Box.  VBoxHeadlessTray is a simple front end that hosts VirtualBox runtime.

Testing on Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7.  


Custom Menu Commands
--------------------

It is possible to customize the context menu that appears when clicking on the 
VBoxHeadlessTray tray icon.  This is done through VBox Guest Properties.

Say the of the VM being hosted was running a web site and you want a quick way to 
launch a web browser for it.  At the command prompt, use the VBoxManage tool (see 
VirtualBox documentation) to add the following guest properties.

In this this example my VM is running a website toptensoftware.ulamp and my machine 
name is devvm

	VBoxManage guestproperty set devvm "VBoxHeadlessTray\ContextMenus\browse\menutext" "Open Web Browser..."
	VBoxManage guestproperty set devvm "VBoxHeadlessTray\ContextMenus\browse\command" "http://toptensoftware.ulamp"
	VBoxManage guestproperty set devvm "VBoxHeadlessTray\ContextMenus\browse\verb" "open"

If verb is empty, the command is executed (CreateProcess) otherwise it's launched with 
ShellExecute.
	
You can optionally set another property to specify the context under which the 
commmand is available (either Running or Stopped).

	VBoxManage guestproperty set devvm "VBoxHeadlessTray\ContextMenus\browse\context" "Running"


Source Code and Build Instructions
---

Source code for VBoxHeadlessTray is available from [github](http://github.com/toptensoftware/VBoxHeadlessTray).

To build:

  1. Get and build SimpleLib - git://github.com/toptensoftware/SimpleLib.git

  2. Get the [VirtualBox SDK](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/vboxsdkdownload.html)
  
  3. Get VBoxHeadlessTray - git://github.com/toptensoftware/VBoxHeadlessTray.git
  
  4. Open and build VBoxHeadlessTray.sln

Expected folder structure is:

    \YourProjectsFolder
      \SDKs
        \VirtualBox4
    	 \sdk
      \SimpleLib
      \VBoxHeadlessTray

To build setup program:

  1. Build both x64 and Win32 Release configs
  
  2. Download and install [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download)
  
  3. Right click on the VBoxHeadlessTraySetup.nsi file in Visual Studio project and select properties
  
  4. Set Excluded from Build to No
  
  5. OK Properties
  
  6. Right click .nsi file again and choose Compile.
  
  7. Set the .nsi file properties back to Excluded from Build.
  
This manual building of the setup is due to the fact that we need both x64 and Win32 exe's for the setup program and Visual Studio doesn't provide a way to do this easily.
